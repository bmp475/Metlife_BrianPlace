2 projects

Part 1 finished. Part 2 not finished. I've never used API before, so only able to get basic structure in place for part 2, need specific 
items pulled from weather site. File will ping API using CSV, return json dict using long/lat parameters. Json file needs to be parsed
and specific features pulled directly from site. Need little more time, syntax unclear, learning curve 
here. Added the code for pandas and writing to csv but not yet functional.
